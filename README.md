# What is this?

I'm not sure. I don't remember this code at all. It was a dark time. I was unemployed, and I had just gone down to Barnes and Noble to pick up some books on programming because I thought I might want to try programming as a career. I was trying to figure out how web programming worked and at the time, "ajax" was still a popular buzzword so I just made up a project for myself to try to do that whole "get some experience in order to have enough experience to get some experience" thing.

I had lost this code and found it on an old backup so I thought I'd put it up here for posterity. Related blog post is [here](http://jeffgran.com/2009/09/04/web-experiments-1-ajax-convo/)
